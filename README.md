About Me
Hello, my name is Sp Siam Ahmed, live in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Katiadi government College.

Coding was always my passion. My journey in web development started at the beginning of my undergraduate life. I have been practicing web development for almost 2+years.

I have begun my web-dev professional journey with some solo client projects. Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at BiTechX, a US-based tech company. My main focus these days is creating full-stack web applications with pixel-perfect frontend and secure backend for various business clients. Also, learning new technologies.
